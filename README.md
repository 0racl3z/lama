## Account manager

The account manager handles account registration and unregistration and emits events to the dedicated coin worker.
Please refer to the [account manager README][account-manager] for more details on how it works.

### Run through docker (recommended)

Install [docker][docker] then run `docker-compose up`.

This will create a PostgreSql, a RabbitMQ, a Redis and the latest published image of the lama account manager.

This will also apply migration on the PostgreSql database through [flyway][flyway].

Please have a look on `docker-compose.yml` file for more details on the configuration.

#### In case you account-manager image doesn't work

To get the last version of the docker image for the Account-Manager, you may have to :

```
$ sbt
> project accountManager
> assembly
> docker
```

### Run manually

Please refer to the [getting started][account-manager-getting-started] section of the account manager README.
